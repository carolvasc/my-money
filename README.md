<h1 align="center">My Money</h1>

Is a finance management system that is very useful for organizing weekly, monthly or any way the user sees fit, as it is totally free to create your payment cycles.

## A little bit about the screens...
<p>The homepage is a dashboard with some cards that inform the totals of credit, debit and their consolidated amount. </p>
<p> The <b>Payment Cycles</b> page lists all cycles already registered and allows their registration, editing and deletion.</p>

### :rocket: Demo
<p>The deploy was made on <b>Netlify</b> and you can access in here https://my-money-cvs.netlify.app/</p>

<p><b>PS:</b> The first request (registration or login) will take a while to return an answer because the API will be in "hibernate" mode.
The "hibernate" "mode happens because the API doesn't get a lot of constant access.</p>
