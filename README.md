<h1 align="center">My Money</h1>

Is a finance management system that is very useful for organizing weekly, monthly or any way the user sees fit, as it is totally free to create your payment cycles.

## A little bit about the screens...
<p>The homepage is a dashboard with some cards that inform the totals of credit, debit and their consolidated amount. </p>
<p> The <b>Payment Cycles</b> page lists all cycles already registered and allows their registration, editing and deletion.</p>
